# wine-quality-classification

In this project, we explored the Wine Quality dataset using both regression and classification approaches.

- **Regression** was used to predict the exact wine quality score.
- **Classification** categorized wines as `low`, `medium`, or `high` quality.
- **Random Forest** performed well in both tasks and provided useful feature importance insights.
- **Logistic Regression** with GridSearchCV allowed us to explore simpler models and tune hyperparameters.
